    <h1>Best Smartphones of 2018</h1>

                <h2>Galaxy S9 Plus</h2>
                <p>
                	The best smartphone around? Certainly for Android fans.
                	If you're after a bigger phone with all the features that matter on board, the Galaxy S9 Plus is that and more.
                	Colours can look a tad washed out when the exposure is higher, but the power of the sensor, with memory built into it to make it smarter than most rivals, offers very low-noise shots.

                <h2>Galaxy Note 9</h2>
                <p>
                	One of the highest-spec phones on the market
                    It's hard to wrap the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 into a mini verdict - it does so much and we've not even touched on the new, camera-remote-enabled Bluetooth S Pen. The expansive, quality screen, the battery life and the camera all combine to make this a stunning smartphone... if you can afford it.

                <h2>iPhone X</h2>
                <p>
                    The best iPhone Apple has ever made
                    This is the phone to buy if you want to treat yourself to a high-end handset â€“ a little extra per month for something you really enjoy taking out of your bag or pocket is worth it (if you can afford it). Will it still be number one next week? It'll need that lower price to hold to stay here...
